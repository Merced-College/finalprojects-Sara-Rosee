My final project will is a Budget Tracker app, and this app is meant to be useful to support users in organizing and tracking their expenses to meet their monthly budget!

When the program starts, users are presented with a menu of numbered options including: Adding a new expense, Viewing total money spent, Viewing expenses grouped by category, Undoing the last added expense, Searching expenses by category, Sorting expenses by amount, Setting a monthly budget limit, Checking whether they are over budget, Displaying all past transactions, and Exiting the program. Each option allows the user to manage their financial data in an organized manner.

Categories are fully customizable by the user, which means they can enter whatever
category they want for that certain expense and it will be saved (food, rent, etc).
I used an ArrayList to store the transactions, HashMap to calculate totals by category, and Stack to implement the undo feature.

This app includes algorithms such as looping for calculating spendings, searching expenses by category, and sorting expenses by amount (selection sort).

This app's purpose it to build habits of financial responsibility for users!
