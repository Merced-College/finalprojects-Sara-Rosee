My final project will is a Budget Tracker app, and this app is meant to be useful as to where it will support users in organizing and tracking their expenses to meet their monthly budget. At the start of the program the user will be asked to choose a number that correlates to adding a new expense, showing how much money theyâ€™ve spent so far, showing expenses by category, an undo option to delete certain expenses, as well as an exit option. Based on the number the user chooses, more options appear to collect data from the user. Some of the categories I have thought of putting into my app include budgets for expenses such as food, rent, entertainment, and clothing. There will also be a feature to set a monthly budget limit, and the app will inform the user whether their budget for that month exceeds or stays within the limit.
